This should be quick-ish. Use the assets (in the "part1" folder) instead of trying to figure out how to do such complex CSS styling (e.g. it's pretty much impossible to make those trees and the lake using CSS).

Same as above, but this will be more difficult.

Consider working on a good template for this first:

You aren't being given any assets for this. Figure out a way to implement it on your own. It might look straightforward (And maybe it is), but it might complicate things that **only the sign with the word "Register" on it should be clickable**.
